The Libre-Mesh project
======================

== Introduction to Libre-Mesh

The Libre-Mesh project (LiMe) was started in 2013 by a set of free networks activists from several countries and different projects,
willing to create a common solution for their networks.

The Libre-Mesh project includes the development of several tools used for deploying libre/free mesh networks.

The firmware (the main piece) will allow simple deployment of auto-configurable, yet versatile, multi-radio mesh networks.
Check link:howitworks.html[How it Works] to see the basic ideas.


== Mesh Networks

Mesh networks are telecomunication networks were all participants (nodes) are able to route traffic from other participants. So there are not central points and the physical topology can be completely random.

== Free Networks

We understand a free network as a telecommunications network which accomplish three points:

. It is open, so anyone can connect to it if physically possible
. It is neutral, so there are not preferences for the kind, origin or destination of the data
. It is free as the Spanish word libre, so there are not restrictions

== Firmware and Embedded Device

An embedded device is a small computer. Usually the operating system running in such small computers is called Firmware.
