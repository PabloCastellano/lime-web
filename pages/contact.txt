== Communication

It is possible to communicate with the current community members using mail and IRC.
All project related communication should be done on public channels that are
archived and easily browsable. Specific problems and tasks may be resolved
using direct means of communication.


=== Mailing Lists

The project offers the following mailing lists

. https://lists.libre-mesh.org/mailman/listinfo/dev[dev@lists.libre-mesh.org] -
  This list is used for general development related work.
. https://lists.libre-mesh.org/mailman/listinfo/users[users@lists.libre-mesh.org] - 
  This list is used for project organisational purposes. And for user specific questions.


=== IRC Channels

The project uses an IRC channel on freenode

. #lime - a public channel for everyone to join and participate


=== Corporate Contact

There is a special email address that companies wanting to collaborate with the
project can use to contact committers confidentially. These types of "first contact"
only have the purpose of helping companies understand the mode of operations. Once the
intent is communicated, companies are invited to participate in the project just
like any other community member. This means that engagement should be done in
public. Ideally companies simply allow part of their R&D team to participate
in the normal development process as normal community members. There will be
no special treatment beyond the "first contact".
