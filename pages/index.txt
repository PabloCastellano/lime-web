== Introduction to libre-mesh

The Libre-Mesh project (LiMe) was started in 2013 by a set of free networks activists from several countries and different projects,
willing to create a common an single solution for their networks.


The Libre-Mesh project includes the development of several tools used for deploying libre/free mesh networks.


The firmware (the main piece) will allow simple deployment of auto-configurable, yet versatile, multi-radio mesh networks. 
Check link:howitworks.html[How it Works] to see the basic ideas.


== Mesh networks

Mesh networks are such networks

== Free networks

We understand a free network as a telecomunications network which accomplish three points:

. It is open, so anyone can connect to it if physically possible
. It is neutral, so there are not preferences for the kind, origin or destination of the data
. It is free as the spanish world libre, so there are not restrictions

== Firmware and embedded device

TBD
