== The Source Code

The code is stored inside a git tree which contains all branches and releases. 

All repositories can be browsed online through
http://github.com/libre-mesh/[Gitweb] as well.

=== Getting The _LiMe_ Code

Any _LiMe_ development happens in the main +source.git+ repository which is
accessible via HTTPS:

----
git clone https://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-packages.git
----

=== The Web Presence

The pages you're reading are generated from text files using the
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] suite. Any changes made to the
projects web site will be reflected in our +web.git+ repository:

----
git clone https://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-web.git
----

=== Submitting Patches

We accept pull requests via GitHub. But patches can also be submitted via the dev mailing list.
Submissions should follow these rules


=== Reporting Bugs

. *All* bug reports need to be submitted via the dev mailing list.
. When reporting bugs please make sure to
  .. Name the branch/revision
  .. Name the effected device
  .. What does it do that it should not do / what does it not do that it should do
  .. Steps to reproduce
  .. What you have already done to fix the problem
  .. Any additional info you think is important
. Reporting a bug means that you reported a bug. It does not constitute a claim that
  anyone has to work on fixing it.
. Pointless/vague/silly/... bugs reports will be ignored
. Feature requests are not Bugs. They will also be ignored.
. The better your bug report, the more likely it is that it will be worked on.
