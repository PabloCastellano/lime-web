Tplink wdr 3500
===============

== TPlink WDR 3500

Because of the new FCC rules, new TPlink models would require a special method to install third party firmwares like LiMe.

In short, you have to install dd-wrt, then roll back to original firmware
using another .bin downloaded from dd-wrt, then you can finally install
lime. And you must rename the file to the name of one of the official
tp-link firmware files (wdr3500v1_en_us_3_14_3_up_boot(151104).bin is what
worked for me).
