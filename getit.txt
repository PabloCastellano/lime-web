== Download Precompiled Binaries

We offer a list of precompiled **generic** firmware images. This is the easiest way to first test and install LiMe in your router.

* The **stable tested release** images can be found at https://chef.altermundi.net/ls/libre-mesh/[Chef] site (the bigger the revision number the newer the release).

* For more targets and LiMe versions you can use the automatic generated, not tested, images from http://builds.libre-mesh.org/[Lime-Build].


== Use the Chef Application

Chef is our own web application for generating customized firmware images.

https://chef.altermundi.net[Chef homepage.]

== Compile Using the Tool lime-build

LiMe build is a tool to easy compile a fresh firmware image and it also creates a development environment.
Basically it consists in one Makefile, so it is executed using the GNU "make" command.
See the https://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-build/blob/develop/README.md[README] for more information.

Clone lime-build git repository
----
git clone https://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-build.git
cd lime-build
----

You can see the list of officialy supported targets and profiles by typing:
----
make info
----

To compile a target/profile just execute (example):
----
make T=ar71xx P=generic J=4
----

[NOTE]
================
* T is the target related to the hardware type.

* P is the profile related to the software combination of packets.

* J is the number of cores to use when compiling (can make it faster).
================

If you need extra packages launch the _menuconfig_ before compiling:

----
make T=ar71xx P=generic menuconfig
----

The default branch is always the last stable release. If you need to compile another branch of Libre-Mesh (https://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-build/branches[list] of the existing branches) you can easy change it using git:

----
git branch -a
git checkout <your favorite branch>
----

You will find the binaries ready to install in _output_ directory.


== Compile the Code Using Pristine OpenWrt buildroot

Clone OpenWRT stable repository.

----
git clone git://git.openwrt.org/15.05/openwrt.git
cd openwrt
----

Add lime-packages feed to the default ones.

----
cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
echo "src-git lime https://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-packages.git" >> feeds.conf
----

Download the new packages.

----
scripts/feeds update -a
scripts/feeds install -a
----

Select needed packages from LiMe menu in menuconfig.

----
make menuconfig
----

Compile the firmware images.

----
make -j4
----

The resulting files will be present in _bin_ directory.
