======


== Download Precompiled Binaries

We offer a list of precompiled **generic** firmware images. This is the easiest way to first test and install LiMe in your router.

https://chef.altermundi.net/ls/libre-mesh/[Stable releases with generic configuration] (the bigger the revision number the newer the release).

== Use the Chef Application

Chef is our own web application for generating customized firmware images.

https://chef.altermundi.net[Chef homepage.]

== Compile Using the Tool lime-build

LiMe build is a tool for developers, it creates a development environment for libre-mesh.
Basically it consists in one Makefile, so it is executed using the GNU "make" command.

Clone lime-build git repository
----
git clone https://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-build.git
----

You can see the list of officialy supported targets by typing:
----
make list_targets
----
If your target is not listed then you can use some generic target such as _ar71xx_

From now on, you must always use T=<your_target> when invoking _make_. As example we use Tplink wdr4300.

Launch the _menuconfig_ to select extra packages or leave it as is per default

----
make T=tl-wdr4300 menuconfig
----

Then launch the compilation process using J=<number_of_cpu_cores>

----
make T=tl-wdr4300 J=4
----

When finish, if not errors, you will find the binaries ready to install inside directory _images_


== Compile the Code Yourself

Clone OpenWRT stable repository.

----
git clone git://git.openwrt.org/15.05/openwrt.git
----

Add lime-packages feed to the default ones.

----
cd openwrt
cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
echo "src-git lime https://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-packages.git" >> feeds.conf
----

Download the new packages.

----
scripts/feeds update -a
scripts/feeds install -a
----

Select needed packages from LiMe menu in menuconfig.

----
make menuconfig
----

Compile the firmware images.

----
make -j4
----

The resulting files will be present in bin/ directory.
